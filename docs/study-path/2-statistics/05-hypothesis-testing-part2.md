## 1. Important Statistical Tests 🔍

- Statistical tests help evaluate hypotheses using sample data.
- These tests depend on the type of variable and distribution of the data.

### Use Case Example:
A pharmaceutical company uses a two-sample t-test to evaluate whether a new drug leads to better recovery rates than the current standard treatment.

## 2. Test for Equality of Means 🧪

- Compares whether two population means are equal.
- Equal or unequal standard deviations affect which t-test is used.

### Use Case Example:
Comparing the mean spending between male and female customers in a shopping dataset.

## 3. Paired t-Test for Equality of Means 🧠

- Used when observations are paired (before-after, matched subjects).
- Measures mean difference between paired samples.

### Use Case Example:
Analyzing weight loss before and after a fitness program.

## 4. Test for One Proportion 📊

- Tests if a sample proportion differs from a known value.
- Uses binomial distribution approximation to the normal.

### Use Case Example:
A poll estimates that 60% of voters support a candidate. Test whether this differs significantly from a 50% benchmark.

## 5. Test for Two Proportions 📊

- Compares proportions from two independent groups.

### Use Case Example:
Comparing the click-through rates between two versions of an email campaign.

## 6. Test for One Variance 📏

- Determines if sample variance matches a hypothesized population variance.
- Uses chi-square distribution.

### Use Case Example:
Quality control process to determine if the variance of weights in packages meets acceptable limits.

## 7. Test for Equality of Variances 🔎

- Tests whether two samples have equal variance.
- Essential for determining assumptions of further tests.

### Use Case Example:
Comparing exam score variability between two universities.

## 8. Test of Independence 🔬

- Tests whether two categorical variables are independent.
- Chi-square test of independence used.

### Use Case Example:
Checking if product preference is related to gender using survey data.

## 9. Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) 📈

- Tests whether means of multiple groups are equal.
- F-test used to compare variance across groups.

### Use Case Example:
Comparing test scores of students from multiple schools to evaluate effectiveness of teaching methods.
