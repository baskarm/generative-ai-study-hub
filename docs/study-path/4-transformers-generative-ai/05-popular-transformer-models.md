## 1. BERT: Encoder-Only Transformer Architecture

BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) revolutionized NLP in 2018 by introducing a bidirectional, encoder-only architecture designed for deep contextual understanding of language. This section explores BERT‚Äôs structure, training strategy, practical applications, and the latest advancements in its ecosystem.

### Model Overview

#### Key Characteristics

- **Bidirectional**  
  BERT reads text in both directions (left-to-right and right-to-left) simultaneously to capture full context.

- **Encoder-Only Architecture**  
  Built entirely on stacked encoders with self-attention mechanisms.  
  Optimized for understanding, not generating, text.

- **Representations**  
  Learns dense vector embeddings that reflect token meaning in context.

- **Transformer-Based**  
  Leverages the original transformer architecture‚Äîonly the encoder side.

### Pre-training Strategy

#### Datasets

- English Wikipedia  
- 10,000+ unpublished English books  
- Total: Over 3 billion words

#### Pre-training Objectives

- **Masked Language Modeling (MLM)**  
  Randomly masks 15% of tokens; the model must predict them using surrounding context.  
  Enables deep semantic and syntactic comprehension.

- **Next Sentence Prediction (NSP)**  
  Trains BERT to classify whether one sentence follows another.  
  Aids understanding of inter-sentence relationships.  
  Later models (e.g., RoBERTa) removed this due to limited benefit.

### Fine-tuning Applications

#### Text Classification

- Sentiment analysis, spam detection, topic categorization  
- Produces a single class label from the encoded text

#### Named Entity Recognition (NER)

- Identifies token-level entities (e.g., people, dates, organizations)  
- BERT's contextual awareness improves accuracy in boundary detection

#### Extractive Question Answering

- Extracts answers directly from a provided context passage  
- Predicts **start** and **end** token positions  
- Used in customer service, document retrieval

#### Semantic Similarity

- Produces embeddings for entire sentences or passages  
- Used in:
  - Duplicate detection  
  - Paraphrase recognition  
  - Semantic search  
  - Vector-based retrieval systems

### BERT Model Variants

| DeBERTa      | Varies     | Disentangled attention and enhanced position embeddings (Microsoft) |

### Latest Developments (as of 2025)

- BERT is foundational for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and embedding-based search systems.
- **Multilingual BERT (mBERT)** supports 100+ languages.
- BERT encoders are commonly paired with large decoders like GPT-4o for hybrid retrieval-generation systems.
