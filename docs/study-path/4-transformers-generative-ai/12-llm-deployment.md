## Introduction to Multi-GPU Scaling

In this final section, we shift our focus from single-machine optimization to **scaling across multiple GPUs or nodes**. While techniques such as quantization, LoRA, and flash attention helped maximize limited resources, we now explore strategies that increase total computational power by adding hardware.

[Back to Top](#quick-navigation)

---

## Why Scaling is Necessary

Scaling allows us to break free from the physical constraints of a single GPU. There are two primary motivations for doing so:

- **Training larger models**: Eventually, no matter how optimized, a model won't fit into GPU memory.
- **Faster training**: Even for smaller models, scaling enables faster iteration and experimentation by parallelizing the training workload.

State-of-the-art LLMs (like GPT-4, Gemini, Claude) are trained across **hundreds to thousands of GPUs simultaneously**.

[Back to Top](#quick-navigation)

---

## Strategic Goals of Scaling

Scaling isn‚Äôt only about ‚Äúgoing bigger.‚Äù It‚Äôs also about going **faster**, or both.

- **Goal 1**: Train **larger models** that wouldn't fit in memory otherwise.
- **Goal 2**: Train **faster**, reducing the time per epoch or iteration.
- **Hybrid Goal**: Train **moderately larger models faster**, using distributed compute efficiently.

üîÅ The balance between size, speed, and hardware availability guides the scaling strategy.

[Back to Top](#quick-navigation)

---

## From Optimization to Hardware Expansion

Previously, we relied on:
- 4-bit quantization
- Flash Attention
- QLoRA
- Efficient batch and sequence tuning

These **maximize utilization of a single GPU**, often squeezing 27B+ parameter models into 24GB cards.

Now, we explore **hardware scaling**, where:
- Multiple GPUs share memory and gradient updates
- Compute is parallelized for greater throughput

This introduces complexity in terms of synchronization, communication overhead, and model sharding, but unlocks **next-level capabilities**.

[Back to Top](#quick-navigation)

---

## Preview of Scaling Frameworks

We will explore and compare two major frameworks for distributed LLM training:

1. **DeepSpeed** (by Microsoft):
   - Efficient training of very large models
   - Includes ZeRO optimizer and communication-efficient primitives

2. **Fully Sharded Data Parallel (FSDP)** (by PyTorch):
   - Parameter, gradient, and optimizer sharding
   - Native PyTorch integration with strong memory savings

Both frameworks enable:
- Multi-GPU training
- Reduced memory load per device
- High-speed training with scalable architecture

Next, we begin hands-on work with **DeepSpeed**.

## What is DeepSpeed

**DeepSpeed** is an open-source deep learning optimization library developed by Microsoft. It is designed to:
- Speed up training
- Enable training of very large models
- Efficiently utilize multiple GPUs through advanced parallelization strategies

Key features include:
- Model parallelism
- Gradient and parameter partitioning
- Memory and compute optimizations

[Back to Top](#quick-navigation)

---

## Why Use DeepSpeed

DeepSpeed is built for high-scale model training. It helps:
- Distribute models across multiple GPUs
- Lower memory footprint per GPU
- Improve throughput in both research and production-scale workloads

It is ideal for:
- Training large LLMs efficiently
- Use cases where hardware and time are critical resources

[Back to Top](#quick-navigation)

---

## ZeRO Optimization Stages

The core innovation of DeepSpeed is the **ZeRO (ZeRO Redundancy Optimizer)** framework, which is broken down into three stages:

### Stage 1: ZeRO-1
- Partitions optimizer states across GPUs
- Provides slight memory savings
- Fastest among all stages

### Stage 2: ZeRO-2
- Partitions both optimizer states and gradients
- Reduces memory load further
- Slower than ZeRO-1 due to added overhead

### Stage 3: ZeRO-3
- Partitions optimizer states, gradients, and model parameters
- Offers maximum memory savings
- Slowest stage due to high communication overhead

[Back to Top](#quick-navigation)

---

## Comparison of ZeRO Stages

| Stage     | Speed       | Memory Efficiency | Components Partitioned                         |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| ZeRO-1    | üü¢ Fastest  | üî¥ Lowest          | Optimizer states                               |
| ZeRO-2    | üü° Moderate | üü° Moderate        | Optimizer states + Gradients                   |
| ZeRO-3    | üî¥ Slowest  | üü¢ Highest         | Optimizer states + Gradients + Model Parameters|

[Back to Top](#quick-navigation)

---

## When to Use Each Stage

- **ZeRO-1**: Use when training time is the main constraint and memory is not a major issue.
- **ZeRO-2**: Use when training moderately large models with balanced speed/memory tradeoff.
- **ZeRO-3**: Use when maximum model size is required, even at the cost of training speed.

These stages give developers flexibility to choose based on their needs and available hardware.

## Setting Up the Environment

In this lesson, we apply DeepSpeed practically to train the `Meta-LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct` model using two GPUs.  
The goal is to optimize **training speed** rather than memory efficiency.

- Starting from an Axolotl-based setup
- Using the SQuAD dataset
- Measuring single-GPU vs. multi-GPU time comparisons

[Back to Top](#quick-navigation)

---

## Training LLaMA 3-8B Without DeepSpeed

Initial benchmark:
- Run on **1 GPU**
- Training time: ~1 hour 40 minutes
- CUDA visibility set to restrict GPU usage
- Dataset: `squad-for-llms`
- Model: `Meta-LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct`

This baseline helps quantify the gains from enabling DeepSpeed later.

[Back to Top](#quick-navigation)

---

## Enabling DeepSpeed Integration

DeepSpeed support is built into Axolotl. It provides default JSON configs for:
- ZeRO-1
- ZeRO-2
- ZeRO-3

### How to Enable:
1. Copy the desired config (e.g., `ZeRO1.json`) from [Axolotl DeepSpeed Configs](https://github.com/axolotl-ai-cloud/axolotl/tree/main/deepspeed_configs)
2. Set it in your training command via `deepspeed` parameter
3. Launch Axolotl with multiple GPUs (remove `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` restriction)

```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1 accelerate launch train.py --deepspeed=ZeRO1.json ...
```

üü¢ Outcome: Multi-GPU training initiated with backend set to DeepSpeed

[Back to Top](#quick-navigation)

---

## Running Training on Multiple GPUs

- Training is re-launched using both GPUs
- ZeRO-1 stage selected (focused on speed, not memory saving)
- Each GPU runs a **full copy** of the model
- Results:
  - New training time: ~1 hour
  - ~40% speed improvement with 2 GPUs

üîÅ Although not linear, the scaling is significant and useful in production and experimentation workflows.

## 1. Overview of FSDP

**FSDP (Fully Sharded Data Parallel)** is a PyTorch-native distributed training framework developed by Meta AI. It's designed for **efficient memory usage and scalability** while training large models‚Äîespecially LLMs.

- Origin: Introduced by Meta within the PyTorch ecosystem.
- Key Use: Enables models too large for single GPU memory.
- Core Idea: Shard model weights, gradients, and optimizer states across multiple GPUs.

üß© **Main Capabilities:**

- Memory-efficient training via model sharding.
- Smart offloading of model shards between GPU and CPU.
- Compatible with massive models (GPT-like, BERT variants).
- Reduces per-GPU memory footprint ‚Üí supports larger batch sizes.

[Back to Top](#quick-navigation)

---

## 2. Why FSDP Over DDP?

| Technique | Replicates Model | Memory Pooling | Model Size Suitability | Use Case |
|----------|------------------|----------------|-------------------------|----------|
| DDP (Distributed Data Parallel) | ‚úÖ Full model replicated | ‚ùå No memory pooling | Medium | Speed-focused training |
| FSDP | ‚ùå Fully sharded | ‚úÖ Memory-efficient | Large-scale | Training LLMs beyond single GPU |

üîç Unlike DDP, FSDP:
- Does **not** replicate the full model.
- **Shards** weights across GPUs.
- Optimizes **both training speed and memory usage**.

[Back to Top](#quick-navigation)

---

## 3. Sharding Strategies in FSDP

FSDP provides 4 sharding strategies, similar in spirit to ZeRO stages (used by DeepSpeed):

### üîµ No Sharding

- Equivalent to DDP.
- No memory savings.
- Fastest strategy (lowest overhead).
- Use if memory isn‚Äôt a bottleneck.

### üü° Gradients & Optimizer Sharding (Similar to ZeRO Stage 2)

- Gradients and optimizer states are sharded.
- Parameters still replicated.
- Balanced trade-off between speed and memory.

### üü¢ Hybrid Sharding

- Shards parameters + optimizer states.
- Maintains full copy of model on each GPU for fast inference.
- Best for scenarios with frequent inference and evaluation needs.

### üî¥ Full Sharding (Similar to ZeRO Stage 3)

- Shards everything: parameters, gradients, optimizer states.
- Best memory efficiency.
- Ideal for very large models.
- Adds communication overhead ‚Üí may slow down training.

üìä **Sharding Strategy Comparison Table:**

| Strategy | Parameters | Gradients | Optimizer | Memory Efficient | Fast Inference | Best For |
|----------|------------|-----------|-----------|------------------|----------------|----------|
| No Shard | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | üî¥ | üü¢ | Small models |
| Grad+Opt | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | üü° | üü° | Balanced setup |
| Hybrid   | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | üü¢ | üü¢ | Training + eval |
| Full     | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | üü¢üü¢üü¢ | üî¥ | Huge models |

## 4. Model Comparison: FSDP vs ZeRO

| Feature | FSDP | ZeRO (DeepSpeed) |
|--------|------|------------------|
| Native to | PyTorch | DeepSpeed/ONNX |
| Sharding Levels | Full | Stage 1 to 3 |
| CPU Offloading | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| Model-Agnostic | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| Hardware Compatibility | Any PyTorch GPU setup | Azure/AWS optimized |
| Supported Community | Meta AI | Microsoft |

üîé FSDP has tighter PyTorch integration, making it easier for native PyTorch workflows.

## 5. When to Use FSDP

üèÅ **Best suited when:**

- You're training models with billions of parameters.
- GPU memory is insufficient for full-model replication.
- You need to scale across 4+ GPUs with low memory usage.
- You want fine-grained control over training memory behavior.

üö© **Not necessary when:**

- Models fit easily on a single GPU.
- Training speed is more important than memory savings.

üß† Bonus: Even without full sharding, FSDP helps reduce memory usage to allow **larger batch sizes**.
