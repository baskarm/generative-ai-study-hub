## 1. Course Introduction

This course is designed to teach transformer architectures and large language model workflows, combining theory and hands-on implementation.

- The course is split into five major parts, each building on the previous.
- Initial sections are theory-heavy but short and packed with examples.
- Ideal for both beginners and experienced NLP practitioners.
- Designed for progressive skill development: from theory → models → coding → deployment.

## 2. Instructor's Advice

- Leave feedback after engaging with multiple sections.
- Reviews improve course discoverability and help maintain high-quality material.
- Beginner sections are **mandatory** for understanding transformer mechanics.
- Experienced practitioners are encouraged to revisit foundational concepts.

## 3. Coding Environment Setup

- Recommended editor: **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**
- VS Code is:
  - Free, lightweight, and open-source
  - Well-integrated with remote environments and Jupyter workflows

### VS Code Setup

1. Install **Python Extension** in VS Code.
2. Enable interactive mode:
   - Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac
   - Search: “send to interactive”
   - Enable this feature for real-time execution feedback

## 4. Tools & Extensions

- **Google Colab Notebooks** provided for each practical lesson:
  - No local setup required
  - Accessible via “Resources” button in each lesson

- **Python Source Files** available for download alongside Colab notebooks

- **Remote Development** using:
  - VS Code’s **Remote SSH Extension**
  - Setup:
    - Edit `~/.ssh/config` with remote VM/IP
    - Connect via bottom-left VS Code status bar

## 5. Practical Coding Guidelines

- Code alongside the instructor.
- Pause and reflect — do not just watch passively.
- Adopt a **top-down learning strategy**:
  - Start from complete example code → adapt it to solve real problems
  - Encouraged for better retention and understanding
