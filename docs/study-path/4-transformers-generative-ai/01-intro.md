## Part 1: Fundamentals of NLP and Transformers

You‚Äôll explore the evolution of natural language processing (NLP) through four historical phases:

- **Rule-Based Systems**  
  - Manually defined rules for parsing, tagging, and other language tasks.

- **Statistical Methods**  
  - Used mathematical probability and co-occurrence to model language.

- **Machine Learning Era**  
  - Leveraged labeled data for training classifiers like SVMs and Naive Bayes.

- **Deep Learning & Embeddings**  
  - Enabled dense semantic understanding and contextual word representations.

### Transformer Foundations

??? info "Why Attention Matters in Transformers"

    The attention mechanism enables a model to focus on relevant portions of the input,  
    rather than treating every token equally. This allows:

    - Better context awareness
    - Improved long-range dependency modeling
    - Reduced reliance on fixed-size memory

    üîç **Example:** In translation, attention helps align source and target tokens precisely.


You‚Äôll also build a deep understanding of the architecture that powers modern LLMs:

- **Attention Mechanism**  
  - Allows models to focus on important parts of the input.

- **Encoder-Decoder Structure**  
  - Enables tasks like translation, summarization, and text generation.

- **Tokenization & Embeddings**  
  - Converts text into vectors, enabling model computation.

- **Pretraining and Fine-Tuning**  
  - Learn how general-purpose models adapt to specific tasks.

## Part 2: Working with Large Language Models (LLMs)

This section focuses on state-of-the-art transformer-based models and their practical applications.

### Key Model Architectures

- **BERT (Encoder-only)**  
  - Learns bidirectional context; ideal for understanding tasks like classification or Q&A.

- **GPT (Decoder-only)**  
  - Generates coherent, fluent text; the backbone of tools like ChatGPT.

- **T5 (Encoder-Decoder)**  
  - Treats all problems as a text-to-text task, offering maximum flexibility.

### Real-World Tasks You‚Äôll Implement

- Masked Language Modeling (MLM)  
- Semantic Search with embeddings  
- Document-Based Question Answering  
- Instruction-Following Text Generation  
- Product Review Generation (prompt-based)

### Advanced Tooling and Techniques

You‚Äôll gain hands-on experience with modern model optimization strategies:

- LoRA and PeFT (parameter-efficient fine-tuning)  
- 8-bit / 4-bit quantization for faster, smaller models  
- FlashAttention, DeepSpeed, and FSDP for accelerated training  
- Chat templates and RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback)


??? info "Why Fine-Tuning is Crucial"

    Fine-tuning pre-trained models is essential when applying LLMs to specialized or production environments. It enhances the model's ability to understand domain-specific language, improves generalization, and reduces errors.

    **Benefits of Fine-Tuning:**
    
    - ‚úÖ Adapts general models to niche domains (e.g., law, healthcare, finance)
    - üìà Boosts model performance on specific downstream tasks
    - üß† Learns contextual and jargon-heavy nuances
    - üíæ Saves compute compared to training from scratch

    üîç **Example:**  
    Fine-tuning BERT on clinical notes dramatically improves performance in electronic health record (EHR) classification tasks.
