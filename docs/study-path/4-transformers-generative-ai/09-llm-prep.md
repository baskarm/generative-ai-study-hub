## Understanding Sequence Length

In this foundational lesson, we examine the concept of **sequence length** in large language models (LLMs), particularly as it relates to **fine-tuning** and model design. Sequence length determines how much context a model can consider during training and inference. Once a model is trained with a specific maximum sequence length, this cannot be extended without retraining.

### Key Concepts

- **Sequence Length** defines the number of tokens a model can process at once.  
- This parameter is **fixed after pretraining**.  
- You can feed shorter inputs into a longer-trained model, but **not vice versa**.  

[Back to Top](#quick-navigation)

---

## Why Sequence Length Matters

### Fixed Architecture Constraint

- Pretraining fixes the maximum window size (e.g., 4K, 8K, 16K tokens).  
- Longer contexts require higher computational resources and memory.  

### Unidirectional Compatibility

- Models trained with longer windows can handle shorter inputs effortlessly.  
- Short-window models **cannot be upgraded** to handle longer contexts post hoc.  

[Back to Top](#quick-navigation)

---

## Hardware Implications

Sequence length directly impacts **training and inference costs**:

- Longer sequence lengths = **higher VRAM requirements**  
- Training larger windows is **exponentially slower**  
- Even inference (e.g., chatbots) demands more memory with longer inputs  

Modern workarounds:

- **Sparse Attention** (e.g., Longformer, BigBird)  
- **Memory-augmented transformers** (e.g., Transformer-XL)  

> These techniques allow partial mitigation of the cost explosion from large contexts.

[Back to Top](#quick-navigation)

---

## Impact on Task Suitability

The sequence length determines the range and complexity of tasks that LLMs can solve. Below is a breakdown:

### Short Sequences (128 - 512 tokens)

- ✅ Sentiment Analysis  
- ✅ Language Detection  
- ✅ Named Entity Recognition  

**Advantages:**

- Faster training  
- Lower compute overhead  
- Context is usually local and easily chunkable  

### Long Sequences (2048+ tokens)

- ✅ Long-form QA  
- ✅ Document Summarization  
- ✅ Scriptwriting / Story Generation  
- ✅ Multi-turn Dialogue Systems  

**Advantages:**

- Maintains global context  
- Enables high-fidelity content generation  
- Suitable for documents, books, and extended chat history  

[Back to Top](#quick-navigation)

---

## Use Cases: Short vs Long Sequences

### Short Sequence Use Cases

- **Sentiment Analysis**: Determine tone from key phrases  
- **NER**: Recognize entities within short contexts  
- **Language Identification**: Detect language using just a few words  

### Long Sequence Use Cases

- **Conversational AI**: Maintain long-term context across multiple exchanges  
- **Content Generation**: Write consistent long-form narratives or reports  
- **Document Understanding**: Answer questions or summarize content from full documents  

> 🔹 These applications demonstrate the **practical trade-offs** of context length in fine-tuning.

## Guidelines for Choosing Sequence Length

| Task Type                   | Suggested Sequence | Benefits                          | Limitations                            |
|----------------------------|--------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Classification (Sentiment, NER) | 128 - 512 tokens     | Efficient, fast inference         | Limited to local context               |
| Chatbots / Assistants      | 2048 - 8192 tokens | Maintains conversational coherence| Higher cost and latency                |
| Summarization              | 4096 - 16000 tokens| Holistic document understanding   | Truncation risk if too short           |
| Code Generation            | 2048 - 8192 tokens | Handles longer code blocks        | Needs longer memory if multi-file      |

## Overview

This lesson introduces the **practical impact of token counts** in generative AI, with hands-on comparisons between various tokenizer behaviors and model capacities. By examining real-world input (e.g., Wikipedia pages), learners gain intuition about:

- Sequence length constraints in models like BERT, LLaMA, and Mistral.
- Vocabulary size trade-offs.
- Tokenization efficiency and its effect on model performance and training design.

[Back to Top](#quick-navigation)

---

## Tokenization Mechanics

- Text tokenization converts raw text into **input IDs** and **attention masks**.
- Input IDs directly affect the **maximum context size** a model can handle.
- For example, the phrase `"fuzzy scientist"` gets broken into only 5 tokens by the LLaMA3 tokenizer.

### Case Study: Wikipedia Paragraph on Whales

- ~170 words = ~300 tokens (using LLaMA3).
- Word-to-token ratio is approximately **1.76x**.
- Demonstrates how even short paragraphs can consume large portions of traditional transformer limits.

[Back to Top](#quick-navigation)

---

## Tokenizer Comparisons

### Same Paragraph, Different Tokenizers:

- **BERT**: ~20 more tokens than LLaMA3.
- **Mistral**: ~30 more than BERT, ~50 more than LLaMA3.

### Full Section (~1,000 tokens):

- Fits within LLaMA3 and Mistral (8K–32K context sizes).
- Exceeds BERT’s 512-token limit.

### Entire Wikipedia Page:

- **LLaMA3**: ~21,000 tokens
- **Mistral**: ~26,000 tokens

🟢 **Mistral** fits due to 32K context, but is near capacity.

## Vocabulary Size & Token Efficiency

| Model     | Vocabulary Size | Tokens Needed for Wiki Page | Notes |
|-----------|------------------|-----------------------------|-------|
| LLaMA3    | 128,000          | 21,000                      | More efficient; fewer tokens per input |
| Mistral   | 32,000           | 26,000                      | Less efficient but smaller vocab size |

- **Trade-off**:
  - Larger vocab → fewer tokens → more efficient inference
  - Smaller vocab → easier pretraining → more tokens used

- **Tokenizer Strategy**:
  - LLaMA3: Breaks input into fewer, more specific tokens.
  - Mistral: Uses more tokens to represent same input.

📌 **Takeaway**: Vocabulary size directly impacts **token efficiency**, **model generalization**, and **context window utilization**.

## Overview

This lesson explores the role of **numerical precision** in training and deploying large language models (LLMs). Understanding how floating-point representations affect performance, memory efficiency, and hardware compatibility is crucial when working with multi-billion parameter models.

[Back to Top](#quick-navigation)

---

## Numerical Precision in Machine Learning

- In ML, parameters (weights) are represented as **floating-point numbers**.
- Common format: **float32 (32-bit)**, offering high accuracy but high memory cost.
- Trade-off: higher bit precision = better accuracy but slower training & higher memory.

[Back to Top](#quick-navigation)

---

## Precision Formats Explained

### 🔵 Float32 (FP32)

- 32 bits per number → 4 bytes
- High accuracy
- High memory usage

### 🟢 Float16 (FP16) / Mixed Precision

- 16 bits per number → 2 bytes
- Slight loss of precision, but enables:
  - Half the memory
  - Double computation speed (if hardware supports)

### 🟡 BF16 (Brain Floating Point 16)

- Also 16-bit, optimized for machine learning
- Better gradient/weight representation
- Widely adopted in modern models

## Model Size, Memory, and Precision Trade-offs

| Precision | Bits | Bytes | 8B Param Model Memory | 70B Param Model Memory |
|-----------|------|-------|------------------------|-------------------------|
| FP32      | 32   | 4     | 32 GB                  | 280 GB                  |
| FP16      | 16   | 2     | 16 GB                  | 140 GB                  |
| INT8      | 8    | 1     | 8 GB                   | 70 GB                   |
| 4-bit     | 4    | 0.5   | 4 GB                   | 35 GB                   |

🧠 Rule of Thumb: For FP16, memory = 2 × parameter count in GB.

[Back to Top](#quick-navigation)

---

## Hardware Limitations and Use Cases

### Consumer GPUs

- RTX 4090: 24GB VRAM
  - Can run 8B models in **inference** mode using FP16
  - Cannot support full training due to memory overhead

### Enterprise GPUs

- NVIDIA A100/H100: 40–80GB VRAM
  - Can train 7–13B parameter models with FP16
  - Need **multi-GPU** setups for models ≥70B

[Back to Top](#quick-navigation)

---

## Lower Precision Formats (INT8, 4-bit)

- **INT8**: 1 byte per param → 8B model = 8 GB
- **4-bit**: 0.5 bytes per param → 8B model = 4 GB

✅ Pros:
- Drastic memory savings
- Enables huge models to fit on limited VRAM

⚠️ Cons:
- Lower precision may reduce model accuracy
- Often used in **inference**, not training

[Back to Top](#quick-navigation)

---

## Precision vs Speed: Hardware Implications

- GPUs are **optimized for FP16/FP32**
- Very low-precision formats (e.g., INT4) may:
  - Require internal conversions
  - Lead to **slower inference**
  - Reduce ability to utilize full GPU throughput

📌 In practice:
- Use FP16/BF16 for training
- INT8/INT4 for memory-constrained inference

## Overview

In this chapter, we explore how to define and control your LLM training pipeline using Axolotl's YAML-based configuration system. The focus is on training a small decoder-only model (TinyLlama) to generate short stories based on prompts using a dataset from Hugging Face.

[Back to Top](#quick-navigation)

---

## Training Control with YAML Config

Axolotl leverages `.yml` configuration files to simplify LLM training orchestration. Rather than scripting logic, users can define:

- Model checkpoint and architecture
- Tokenizer type
- Dataset path and format
- Training hyperparameters
- Output and logging setup

This allows non-programmers or fast-moving practitioners to quickly train, tune, and test models.

[Back to Top](#quick-navigation)
---

## Model Setup Parameters

Key fields in the YAML:

- `base_model`: Pretrained checkpoint (e.g., TinyLlama 1.1B Chat)
- `model_type`: Architecture class (LlamaForCausalLM)
- `tokenizer_type`: Hugging Face tokenizer class (LlamaTokenizer)
- `sequence_length`: Input length cap (e.g., 1024)
- `precision`: Uses `bf16` (brain float 16), auto-detected if supported

These map to common fields expected by Hugging Face models and tokenizers.
[Back to Top](#quick-navigation)

---

## Dataset & Formatting Logic

Dataset used: `jaydenccc/AI_Storyteller_Dataset`

- Contains:
  - `synopsis` → serves as instruction prompt
  - `short_story` → target output the model learns

### Formatting

```text
<|user|>
 {instruction} </s>
<|assistant|>
 {short_story}
```

- Follows the LLaMA chat template
- Ensures correct message alignment in decoder-only models
- Axolotl handles the formatting and tokenization logic internally

## Overview

This chapter concludes the first end-to-end training workflow using Axolotl and TinyLlama. We run the training script, observe the model's learning progress, and evaluate its performance with sample prompts to test generalization.

## Starting the Training Loop

Once the YAML configuration file (`basic_train.yml`) is ready, you can launch training by running:

```bash
python -m axolotl.cli.train basic_train.yml
```

- Loads the specified model (TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0)
- Tokenizes dataset `jaydenccc/AI_Storyteller_Dataset`
- Starts training loop with live logging

🟢 Axolotl automatically applies formatting, precision, and optimizer choices from the YAML.

## Monitoring Loss and Epochs

- Training loss is printed at each step due to `logging_steps: 1`
- For a small dataset:
  - Training is fast (few minutes with 4 epochs)
  - Loss decreases with each batch, indicating effective learning

🧠 Despite the minimal size of the dataset, the model learns the task effectively due to repetition and targeted prompts.

## Testing the Trained Model

Here's a sample Python test script:

```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM
import torch

model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
    "./models/TinyLlama_Storyteller", 
    torch_dtype=torch.float16, 
    device_map="auto"
)
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("./models/TinyLlama_Storyteller")

# Prompt: Bright student working with a fuzzy scientist
prompt = "<|user|>
A bright student was working with the fuzzy scientist on a project.</s>
<|assistant|>"

inputs = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors="pt").to("cuda")
outputs = model.generate(**inputs, max_new_tokens=512)

print(tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True))
```

### Results:

- The model returns coherent short stories in response to prompts like:
  - *"A bright student was working with a fuzzy scientist on a project."*
  - *"A global mission for humanity through overcrowded cities."*

🎯 Even with limited training, the model generalizes narrative structure well.
