## 1. Transformer Architecture Overview

This lesson introduces the transformer model architecture, emphasizing its structural innovations, key mechanisms, and how it revolutionized NLP by overcoming the limitations of RNNs and LSTMs.

### Origins and Significance

- Introduced in 2017 via the paper *"Attention Is All You Need"*
- Replaced sequential RNN/LSTM processing with fully parallel architecture
- Solved long-range dependency issues and improved training speed
- Enabled large-scale model training and breakthroughs in language understanding

### Core Components of Transformer Architecture

#### Encoder-Decoder Structure

- **Encoder**: Converts input text into continuous vector representations capturing context and relationships
- **Decoder**: Generates output text from encoder‚Äôs processed information
- Enables tasks like translation, summarization, and question answering

#### Attention Mechanisms

- **Self-Attention**: Weighs each word relative to others to build context-aware representations
- **Scaled Dot-Product Attention**: Computes dot products, scales scores, and applies softmax
- **Multi-Head Attention**: Uses multiple heads to capture diverse semantic/syntactic patterns

### Positional Encoding

- Compensates for lack of inherent word order in attention-only models
- Adds position-based signals to token embeddings

### Feed-Forward Network & Layer Normalization

- **Feed-Forward Network**: Applies non-linear transformations to extract high-level features
- **Layer Normalization**: Stabilizes training by normalizing outputs between layers

### Full Encoder and Decoder Block

- Composed of stacked layers with:
  - Multi-head attention
  - Feed-forward networks
  - Layer normalization
- **Decoder** includes additional encoder-decoder attention to align output generation

### Real-World Application Example

**Abstractive Question Answering**

- **Input**: Paragraph + Question
- **Encoder**: Processes both into contextual embeddings
- **Decoder**: Generates an answer from the learned representation

### Key Takeaways

- Transformers enabled scalable, parallel NLP processing
- Encoder-decoder architecture allows diverse tasks
- Attention mechanisms are key to understanding global context

## 2. Transformer Training Paradigm: Pre-training and Fine-tuning

This lesson outlines the two-phase training process of transformer models‚Äîpre-training and fine-tuning‚Äîcontrasting it with traditional ML workflows.

### Training Structure Overview

- **Pre-training**: General language learning from large unlabeled datasets
- **Fine-tuning**: Task-specific adaptation using labeled datasets

### Pre-training Phase

- Learns grammar, context, word relationships, and long-range dependencies
- Massive-scale unsupervised training
- üîÅ **Analogy**: Like learning music theory before mastering a genre

### Fine-tuning Phase

- Adapts pre-trained models to tasks like NER, translation, QA, etc.
- Requires smaller supervised datasets
- Leverages **transfer learning**
- üîÅ **Analogy**: Like a trained pianist specializing in jazz

### Combined Workflow

1. **Step 1: Pre-training**
   - Random initialization ‚Üí trained on general data
2. **Step 2: Fine-tuning**
   - Task-specific data ‚Üí adapted for downstream performance

### Real-world Considerations

- Pre-training requires huge compute and data (done by orgs like Google, OpenAI)
- Most use **pre-trained** models and **fine-tune**
- Full pre-training is rare unless:
  - You work with proprietary, underrepresented, or specialized domains (e.g., legal, clinical)

### Key Takeaways

- Pre-training + fine-tuning is the standard approach in NLP
- Enables rapid model deployment with high performance
- Specialized domains may benefit from custom pre-training

## 3. Tokenization and Embeddings in Transformer Models

This lesson covers how transformers process raw text into vector representations using tokenization and embeddings.

### Tokenization

#### Purpose

- Breaks text into smaller units called **tokens**
- Translates natural language into numerical input (token IDs)

#### Types of Tokenization

- **Word-level**: One token per word; suffers from OOV (out-of-vocabulary) issues
- **Character-level**: Every character is a token; leads to longer sequences
- **Subword-level** (common): Breaks unknown words into known parts (e.g., Byte-Pair Encoding)

#### Workflow

1. Breaks text into tokens
2. Maps tokens to IDs using a predefined vocabulary
3. Feeds IDs into the transformer model

### Embeddings

#### Purpose

- Convert token IDs into high-dimensional dense vectors
- Capture **meaning** and **contextual usage** of tokens

#### Key Concepts

- Embeddings are context-aware (e.g., "bank" in finance vs. riverbank)
- Contextual embeddings change based on surrounding text
- Learned during **pre-training**

#### Example

```text
Sentence 1: She picked a rose.
Sentence 2: The sun rose early.
