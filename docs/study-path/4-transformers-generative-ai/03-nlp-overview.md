## 1. Historical NLP Techniques

Understanding the evolution of NLP techniques provides critical context for modern advancements like transformers. This section explores foundational rule-based systems.

### Rule-Based NLP Era

- Built on manually crafted linguistic rules
- Focused on syntactic analysis:
  - **Parsing**: Grammatical structure and relationships
  - **Part-of-Speech Tagging**: Identifying grammatical roles
- Applications:
  - Syntax analysis
  - Text summarization
  - Machine translation

### Key Limitations

- **Ambiguity**: Poor context awareness
- **Scalability**: Rule creation and maintenance were not feasible at scale

## 2. Statistical NLP Era

The transition to data-driven statistical techniques marked a turning point in NLP.

### Key Innovations

- **Data-Driven Shift**: Replaced rules with learned probabilities
- **Probabilistic Language Models**: Modeled word likelihoods and co-occurrence patterns
- **n-Grams**: Captured word sequences (e.g., bigrams, trigrams)
- **Hidden Markov Models (HMMs)**:
  - Used for sequence tasks (POS tagging, NER)
  - Modeled state transitions for linguistic structure

### Applications

- **POS Tagging**: Predict tags using probability sequences
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Detect names, dates, organizations

### Limitations

- **Data Sparsity**: Rare word combinations weakened predictions
- **Shallow Semantics**: Couldn‚Äôt truly ‚Äúunderstand‚Äù meaning

### Evolution

These limitations led to machine learning and neural models, enabling more scalable, adaptive solutions.

## 3. Machine Learning Era in NLP

Machine learning enabled NLP systems to generalize from data without extensive rules or handcrafted features.

### Key Advancements

- **Naive Bayes**: Probabilistic classifier for text classification (e.g., spam detection)
- **Support Vector Machines (SVMs)**:
  - Effective for sentiment analysis
  - Worked well on high-dimensional text vectors

### Rise of Neural Networks

- **Reduced Feature Engineering**: Learned features from raw data
- **Applications**: Summarization, translation, sentiment detection

### Specialized Architectures

- **RNNs**:
  - Process text sequentially
  - Preserve past input using hidden state
  - Limitations: Weak on long-term dependencies

- **LSTMs**:
  - Enhanced RNNs with memory cells
  - Better handling of long-range context
  - Enabled language modeling and generation

### Milestones

- Shifted to **end-to-end learning**
- More flexible and powerful than statistical models

## 4. Embedding Era in NLP

Dense vector embeddings enabled models to capture word meaning and similarity, surpassing sparse representations like one-hot encoding.

### Key Concepts

- **Word Embeddings**:
  - Low-dimensional, dense vectors for each word
  - Capture meaning through context-based learning

- **Benefits Over One-Hot Encoding**:
  - Smaller dimensionality
  - Encoded meaning and similarity

### Popular Embedding Techniques

| Technique    | Developer       | Method                     | Highlights                                           |
|--------------|-----------------|----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Word2Vec     | Google          | Skip-gram, CBOW            | Context prediction via local word windows           |
| GloVe        | Stanford        | Co-occurrence + global stats | Combines frequency and semantics                   |
| FastText     | Facebook AI     | Subword n-grams            | Handles rare and OOV words better                   |

### Applications

- **Semantic Similarity**: Text comparison
- **Text Classification**: Improved input features
- **Translation, QA**: Foundation for neural systems
- **Input to Deep Models**: Used in RNNs, LSTMs, and later transformers

### Limitations

- **Static Embeddings**: One vector per word, no context awareness
- **No Polysemy Handling**: Same vector for multiple meanings (e.g., ‚Äúbank‚Äù)

These drawbacks triggered the rise of **contextualized embeddings** (e.g., ELMo, BERT), marking the start of the **Transformer Era**.
