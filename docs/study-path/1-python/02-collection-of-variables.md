## 1. List Operations

### Concept

A **list** in Python is a mutable, ordered collection of elements. Lists allow duplicate values and support indexing, slicing, and iteration.

### Key Examples

- Create a list with repeated elements
- Print the second element of a list
- Replace an element in a list
- Iterate through a list and print values
- Compute squares of numbers in a list
- Remove (pop) an element from a list
- Check the length of a list

### Use Case Example

In retail analytics, you might use lists to track product IDs sold during a day, apply transformations (e.g., discounts), or aggregate values like revenue per transaction.

## 2. Dictionary Operations

### Concept

A **dictionary** in Python is an unordered, mutable collection that maps keys to values. Keys must be unique and hashable.

### Key Examples

- Create a dictionary with brand, model, and year
- Modify a value in a dictionary (e.g., updating year)

### Use Case Example

Customer profiles in CRM systems often use dictionaries to store user information like `{"name": "John", "age": 45, "premium": True}`.

## 3. Tuple & Set Creation

### Concept

- A **tuple** is an immutable, ordered sequence.
- A **set** is an unordered collection of unique elements.

### Key Example

- Create a set with elements: `1.0`, `"Hello"`, `55`, `(6,7,8)`

### Use Case Example

Sets are used to eliminate duplicates, such as identifying unique website visitors from a log file.
