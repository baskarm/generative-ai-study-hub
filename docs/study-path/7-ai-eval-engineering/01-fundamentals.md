## 1. Introduction

Rapid advances in the development and deployment of LLMs are reshaping applications such as customer service, decision support, and information extraction (Bommasani et al. 2021; Zaharia et al. 2024). However, their adoption outpaces our ability to systematically evaluate them (Ward and Feldstein 2024).

Unlike traditional deterministic software, LLM pipelines yield subjective and context-sensitive outputs. This introduces challenges in evaluation, as conventional metrics like accuracy or F1 score may not apply.

**Core challenge:** How do we evaluate whether an LLM pipeline is performing correctly, and where it might be failing?

[🔼 Back to Top](#quick-navigation)

## 1.1 What is Evaluation?

**Evaluation** is defined as the systematic measurement of LLM pipeline quality. Evaluations can be:

- **Background Monitoring** – passive observation for drift or degradation.
- **Guardrails** – checks that block/alter unsafe outputs.
- **Improvement Tools** – used to improve data labeling, few-shot examples, or prompt design.

Evaluations guide systematic improvements by identifying failure modes, enabling trust, safety, and ongoing enhancement.

## 1.2 The Three Gulfs of LLM Pipeline Development

This framework (Shankar et al. 2025; Norman, 1988) captures the key gaps:

- **Gulf of Comprehension**: Understanding input data and pipeline behavior.
- **Gulf of Specification**: Miscommunication between developer intent and prompt execution.
- **Gulf of Generalization**: Inconsistent LLM responses across different inputs.

> ![Three Gulf of LLM](../../images/3-gulf-llm.png)


> Example: An email processing pipeline that misidentifies a public figure as a sender showcases a generalization failure.

[🔼 Back to Top](#quick-navigation)

## 1.3 Why LLM Pipeline Evaluation is Challenging

Challenges include:

- The **Three Gulfs** resurface uniquely for each task and dataset.
- Evaluation requirements evolve with usage.
- **No universal metric** exists; appropriate ones must be developed per context.
- **Benchmarks** don't capture task-specific failure modes.
- Ground-truth inspection is still necessary for effective evaluations (Shankar et al. 2024d).

[🔼 Back to Top](#quick-navigation)

## 1.4 The LLM Evaluation Lifecycle: Bridging the Gulfs with Evaluation

We adopt a structured approach:
``Analyze → Measure → Improve``

- **Analyze**: Inspect data and behavior to identify comprehension and specification issues.
- **Measure**: Use evaluators to quantitatively assess failure modes.
- **Improve**: Use findings to refine prompts, architectures, or training methods.

> This iterative loop builds reliable and evolving LLM systems.

> ![LLM Evaludation Lifecycle](../../images/llm-eval-lifecycle.png)

[🔼 Back to Top](#quick-navigation)

## 1.5 Summary

- Evaluation is essential for reliable LLMs.
- The Three Gulfs help diagnose sources of failure.
- Metrics must be context-specific and evolve with the system.
- The Analyze–Measure–Improve lifecycle provides a repeatable framework.

## 2.1 Strengths and Weaknesses of LLMs

- **Strengths**: LLMs produce fluent, coherent, grammatically correct text; excel in summarization, translation, editing, etc.
- **Weaknesses**:
  - Limited algorithmic generalization (Qian et al., 2022)
  - Effective context window smaller than expected (Li et al., 2024)
  - Prompt sensitivity (Sclar et al., 2024)
  - Probabilistic output = inconsistent results
  - Hallucination risk (Kalai & Vempala, 2024)

> 📌 **Key Takeaway 2.1**: Treat LLMs as powerful but fallible tools—leverage their strengths while anticipating weaknesses.

## 2.2 Prompting Fundamentals
 
A good prompt includes:
1. **Role and Objective** – Define persona and goal  
2. **Instructions** – Clear, bullet-form directives  
3. **Context** – Include text, data, background  
4. **Examples** – Few-shot guidance  
5. **Reasoning Steps** – CoT (Chain of Thought)  
6. **Formatting Constraints** – JSON, paragraph, etc.  
7. **Delimiters & Structure** – Markdown headers, tags  

[🔼 Back to Top](#quick-navigation)
---

## 2.3 Defining “Good”: Types of Evaluation Metrics

- **Reference-Based**: Compare output to gold labels  
  - Exact match, keyword check, SQL execution  
- **Reference-Free**: Evaluate quality without gold labels  
  - Validity of code, absence of hallucination, stylistic adherence  
  - Examples: LLM-generated API response uses valid schema  

[🔼 Back to Top](#quick-navigation)
---

## 2.4 Foundation Models vs. Application-Centric Evals

- **Foundation Eval**: Benchmarks like MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2021), HELM, GSM8k  
- **Application Eval**: Tailored to specific pipeline goals like legal document fidelity  

> 💡 Tip: Don’t blindly trust benchmarks—build evals for your specific pipeline.

---

## 2.5 Eliciting Labels for Metric Computation

- **Direct Grading**: Human/LLM scoring using rubric  
- **Pairwise Comparison**: A vs B  
- **Ranking**: A > B > C based on rubric dimension  

> 📌 **Key Takeaway 2.2**: Combine direct grading, pairwise, and ranking for rich feedback.

### 2.8.4 Eliciting Labels (Travel Assistant)

You need to evaluate whether a travel assistant’s flight recommendations respect the user’s budget constraint.

#### (a) Direct-Grading Rubric:
- **Within Budget**: All suggested flights have price ≤ user's maxPrice.  
- **Over Budget**: At least one suggested flight exceeds the user's maxPrice.  

#### (b) Pairwise-Comparison Instruction:

**Sample Prompt**:
> You are given a user query: "Find flights under $300 from JFK to LAX."  
> You also have two lists of three flight options (A and B).  
> Choose which list better respects the budget constraint and reply with "A" or "B," followed by a one-sentence justification.

#### (c) When to Use:
- **Direct grading** is ideal when you need an absolute adherence rate and the criterion is unambiguous.  
- **Pairwise comparison** is preferable for borderline cases or when annotators find relative judgments easier than binary labels.

## 1. Shankar & Sim (2024/2025) – *Generative AI on the Loose: Impact of Improved AI and Expert Oversight on Knowledge Sharing*

### 📖 Overview  
This empirical study analyzes the interplay between **advanced GenAI systems (e.g. GPT‑4)** and **expert moderation**, exploring how their combination influences knowledge-sharing on platforms like Stack Overflow.

### 🧠 Core Findings
- Combining high-performing GenAI output with strict expert oversight **reduces content volume** but significantly **improves quality** and reliability.
- When moderation is relaxed, there's a surge in contributions—primarily lower-quality or hallucinated content.
- Insight on skill-level variations: novice users benefit most from expert moderation in maintaining quality.

### ⚙️ Methodology
- Natural experiment around GPT‑4 adoption and Stack Overflow policy changes.
- Mixed-method: measuring variations in content volume and quality across user skill tiers.

### 🎯 Implications
- GenAI alone cannot guarantee content quality; **moderation remains essential**, especially for novice contributors.
- Platform design decisions (e.g. moderation policies) significantly influence the effectiveness and trustworthiness of GenAI-generated content.

### 📄 Reference
- Shankar & Sim (June 2024 / Feb 2025 revision), SSRN: [Generative AI on the Loose](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4867815)

## Rein et al 2024 Status Relevant Findings

---

### ❗ Summary
No exact match was found for a standalone academic paper titled **"Rein et al., 2024"** in the context of large language models or generative AI as of July 2025. However, two references may relate to the citation:

---

## 1. REIN (CVPR 2024) – Efficient Fine-Tuning of Vision Foundation Models

### 📖 Overview
The REIN method, introduced by **Wei et al., 2024**, presents a **parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique** for Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), enabling high-performance semantic segmentation with minimal training overhead.

### 🧠 Key Features
- Uses **learnable instance tokens** to fine-tune models like **ConvNeXt** and **DINOv2**.
- Achieves strong generalization across domains like **Cityscapes** and **Cross-Organ** with <1% additional parameters.
- Demonstrates scalable adaptation without retraining base vision encoders.

### 📄 Reference
- [Wei et al., 2024 - REIN on arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04265)

## 2. Rein et al., 2023 – Benchmark Reference (Indirection)

### 🧩 Context
Some benchmark papers in 2024 (e.g., GPQA and MMLU-X evaluations) cite **“Rein et al., 2023”** in passing, especially regarding expert-level generalization and metric formulation.

### ⚠️ Limitation
No formal standalone paper for **Rein et al., 2024** appears indexed or published as of this writing. It’s possible the citation refers to an unpublished draft or internal benchmark suite.
